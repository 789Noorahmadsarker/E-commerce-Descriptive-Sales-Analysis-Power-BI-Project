This is a descriptive analysis of E-commerce sales data of 4 years (2012-2015) in Power BI  with necessary visualizations.  The analysis report is divided into 4 different segments:

1.	Executive Summary: A summary based on the overall dataset
2.	Customer Performance: Customer analysis for a single year (2012)
3.	Sales Profile: Overall sales condition (Cost. Revenue, Profit) of the dataset
4.	Regional Order: Order Analysis placed by customers from different region

Key findings of the Analysis: After performing the necessary data preparation steps (Data Loading, transformation, Modelling), the following outcomes are found.

Segment  - 1 (Executive Summary):
  -	Following important KPIs were calculated:
      o	Total orders & total number of product Orders
      o	Total number of customers & products recorded in the system
      o	Total sales (cost, revenue, profit, loss) in the record
  -	Among the 4 types of shipping modes (Standard, General, 1st Class, 2nd Class), most shipping were done in Standard mode (almost 60%)
  -	Most customers were simple consumers (over 50%), others were corporate offices or home offices
  -	Almost $1 million dollars of profit was earned via orders placed from Europe & North America. 

Segment  - 2 (Customer Performance):
  -	Following important KPIs were calculated:
      o	Total number of active customers & new customers in 2012
      o	Cohort performance of the customers
      o	Total retained customer & retention rate in 2012
      o	Total churned customer & churn rate in 2012
      o	Number of recovered customers in different months for 2012
  -	New customer arrival was highest in earlier months (January - March) in 2012 compared to the later months; and cohort performance followed the same pattern
  -	Retention rate was higher (around 50%-60%), and churn rate was lower (around 30% - 50%) in the later months since the first transaction month (January) in 2012.
  -	At the second half of 2012, number of retained & recover customer became almost 4 times higher compared to the first half.

Segment  - 3 (Sales Profile):
  -	Following important KPIs were calculated:
      o	Amount of sales (cost, revenue, and profit) in different period
      o	Amount of return sales (return cost, return revenue, and return profit) back to the company in different period
      o	Profit Margin % for different periods
  -	For each KPI (cost, revenue, profit), the comparison between current period amount and previous period amount (last month/last 3 months/ last  6 months/ last year) was done.
  -	Each page of this segment is filterable based on individual product names, so stakeholders can easily observe the sales condition for each product.

Segment  - 4 (Regional Order):

  -	In overall record, Orders were placed by customers from 6 different continents, 164 different countries, and 3,650 different cities around the world.
  -	A map visual was built, to show the number of order quantities and amount of earned revenue, from different countries, states, and cities.
